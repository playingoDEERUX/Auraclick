# Auraclick
A simple undetected c++ internal .dll autoclicker with around ~20cps, good for minecraft if servers you are playing on are well protected against client modificated hacks like KillAura. This should be working/compatable with any window/process, you can simply select your target window using ExtremeInjector.

(initially called it Reclick, then changed my mind and called it 'Auraclick')

# Press F7 to toggle the autoclicker.
